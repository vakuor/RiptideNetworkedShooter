# RiptideNetworkedShooter

Created by Vladislav vakuor Tkachev

## Getting started

This repository contains files with a simple network layer implementation based on the [RiptideNetworking library](https://github.com/RiptideNetworking/Riptide).

This is NOT a production ready solution. It is just my try to make network work on me.

You can build it on your own or just download [builds for Windows](https://github.com/vakuor/RiptideNetworkedShooter/releases/tag/v0.1).

Launch one server instance and countless number of clients (beware of bugs).

## Launch

By default you will be asked to type port field for server and ip+port fields for client.

Make sure the port you are trying to use is not occupied by other applications.

## Controls

Are simple.  
WASD - movement  
QE - rotation  
Space - shooting

## Project status
I think I am not going to continue development. That was just a good practice for me.
